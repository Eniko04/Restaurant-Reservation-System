## 📝 Project Overview

This is a web-based restaurant management system, consisting of two main parts:

- **Back-End (API)** – A RESTful web service for managing clients, tables, and reservations, secured with JWT authentication.
- **Front-End (MVC Client)** – An ASP.NET MVC client that communicates with the API via HTTP, providing an intuitive user interface.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 7)
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Entity Framework Core
- SQLite
- JWT Authentication
- Bootstrap (for styling)

- The MVC client requires login to access protected features.

## 🔍 Search Features

- **Tables** – by number and minimum capacity
- **Reservations** – by client name and table number

## 🔁 Pagination & Sorting
